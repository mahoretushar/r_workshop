IF statement

if (condition) {
statement
}

If the condition is TRUE, the statement gets executed. But if it’s FALSE, nothing happens.

Here, condition can be a logical or numeric vector, but only the first element is taken into consideration.

In the case of numeric vector, zero is taken as FALSE, rest as TRUE

x <- 5
if(x > 0){
print("Positive number")
}

IF Else Statement

if (condition) {
statement1
} else {
statement2
}

The else part is optional and is only evaluated if condition is FALSE.

It is important to note that else must be in the same line as the closing braces of the if statement.

x <- -5
if(x > 0){
print("Non-negative number")
} else {
print("Negative number")
}
