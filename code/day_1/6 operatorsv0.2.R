# What is an operator?
# 
# it is a symbol that is used to assign values or run commands. Operators are used in all programming languages like = sign or <> signs
# 


# Types of Operators
# 
# 
# Arithmetic
# Relational
# Logical
# Assignment
# Miscellaneous
# 
# 
# 
# Arithmetic Operators
# 
# +

2 + 2
# -

3-2 

# *

2 * 2
# /

10 /2 

#   
# %% - Give the remainder of the first vector with the second %%

11%%2

# 
# %/% - The result of division of first vector with second

11%/%2
# 
# ^ first vector raised to the exponent of second vector

2 ^ 3
# 
# Relational Operators
# 
# 
# >	 greater than .

4 > 5 
# <	less than

4 < 5

# ==	is equal to , please only = will be used as assignment operator
4==5
4==4

# <=	less than or equal to 

4 <= 5

# >=	greater than or equal to 

4 >= 5
# !=	NOT equal to

4 != 5
# 
# 



d <- 4
e <- 5

# not a very useful if else block, but just for demonstration purpose on how


# ! - NOT operator, it can be used with equal sign for "NOT Equal" purpose.

d != e 
d != 5


#Assignment Operators
# These operators are used to assign values to vectorsdataframes/matrix/variables/objects.

# <-

f <- 123

# <<-

f <<- 123

# =

f = 123

# 
# ->

ef -> 123
# 
# 
# Others
# 
# :	Colon operator, used to create the series of numbers in sequence for a vector.

nb <- rnorm(1:50)
nb

# Few others
# | - Vertical bar or pipe operator, 
#it is an Element wise Logical OR operator. 
#it gives an output TRUE if one of the elements is TRUE or one of the condition passes. 

# & operator for element wise operation similar to OR 

# The logical operator && and || considers only the first element of the vectors and give a vector of single element as output.
# 
# &&	Logical AND operator. 
#Takes first element of both the vectors and gives the TRUE only if both are TRUE.


# ||	Logical OR operator. 
#Takes first element of both the vectors and gives the TRUE if one of them is TRUE.
